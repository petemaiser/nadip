The "nadip" command line tool enables the user to copy all the settings from a NAD processor or
receiver into a setting file that can then be sent to another processor to "upload" and replace
all the settings on that processor.  Or the setting file can be used a backup.  A single command
can also be sent on the command-line.  This program was quickly written in Objective C via
reusing components from the iOS app DTrol https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dtrol/id1296670853

This program is comes with NO WARRANTY and is a beta version.
You use this program at your own risk.

Usage:  
    nadip  [-l log_file] [-p put_file] [-s settings_file] [-w milliseconds] IP_address IP_port [put_command_string]

    -l  Option for all received commands to be appended to a log file.  The log file is
        different from settings file in that it logs everything received from the processor,
        no more, no less.  The log file records for a brief time period second after nadip has
        sent its last command.  If neither the 'l' option or the 's' option is used the
        responses will be discarded.

    -p	Option to put all the commands to the server from the put file.
        Note that a line that starts with '#' is skipped, except '#!', which is a put file
        command.  If option 'p' is not used then a put command must be supplied as the last
        argument.  Supported '#!' commands are:

            #!p<milliseconds>   pause for the given milliseconds,
                                e.g. "#!500" pauses for half a second

    -s	Option to appended the responses to a settings file.  NAD responses like
        "Main.Power=On" can be sent as commands, so the settings option simple takes the
        responses from a command or put file and saves them to the settings file.  Note
        that put file commands like '#!p' are moved over to the settings file.  The 's'
        option must be run with the 'p' option OR with a single command sent as an
        argument.  If neither the 'l' option or the 's' option is used the responses will be
        discarded.  The log file records for a brief time period second after nadip has sent
        its last command.  Responses that are not settings are skipped:

            Main.Model            Main.Version            Main.Serial

    -w  Option to wait for the given seconds after one command and before starting the
        next command.  For Release 1, when using putting a "settings" file to NAD processor it
        is recommended to use the 'w'option with '50' to put 50 milliseconds between commands.

    IP_address	The IP address, e.g. "10.0.1.10" is the first argument and must be supplied

    IP_port 	The port number, e.g. '4999' is the second argument and must be supplied

    put_command_string  An optional command string will be sent to the processor.  If a put file
        is also included the put file commands will be run first.  If no command string is
        supplied then the 'p' command must be used.
  
Release Updates:

    Release 1.0
        - Initial build.  The program does not at this time enable validated feedback for the
          any send commands.  When creating a 'settings file it records what it receives within
          a brief time period after executing all commands.
        - When using putting a "settings" file to NAD processor it is recommended to use the 'w'
          option with '50' to put 50 milliseconds between commands.
